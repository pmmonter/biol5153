The bigger the database the more likely it is to get a match in a bigger pool of sequences, 
which makes it more likely to get a bigger raw score.

The bit score is just a normalized raw score and does not depend on database size.

The e-value is the number of expected hits of similarly quality that could be found 
just by chance, so the bigger the database the more likely a smaller e-value will be.

These patterns can be explained by the fact that the e-value is a corrected bit-score 
adjusted to the sequence database size, and therefore depends on the size of the used 
sequence database.
