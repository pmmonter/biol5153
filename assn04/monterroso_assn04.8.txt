Under the three different settings, there are 39, 42, and 66 sequences selected for default, somewhat sensitive, and sensitive parameters respectively.
The parameter that this size directly relates to is the sensitivity with which each of these algorithms retrieve either highly similar sequences (fast),
or more dissimilar sequences (slower), or somewhat similar sequences.
